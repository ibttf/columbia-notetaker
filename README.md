# vidnotes
Everytime you access a columbia video url on hosted.panopto.com,
our extension will pop up and ask if you want lecture notes

if you click yes

1) beautiful soup will scrape the transcript contents
2) we’ll feed it into gpt
3) we’ll grab notes
4) we’ll put it in a fun display like notion on a separate url
5) we’ll send you that specific url

questions: do we want more than notes?
is it even possible for us to extract? does cloudfront protect from extension extraction?

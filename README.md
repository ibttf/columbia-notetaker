1) beautiful soup will scrape the transcript contents
2) we’ll feed it into gpt
3) we’ll grab notes
4) we’ll put it in a fun display like notion on a separate url
5) we’ll send you that specific url

questions: do we want more than notes?
is it even possible for us to extract? does cloudfront protect from extension extraction?
